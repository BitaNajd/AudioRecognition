# AudioRecognition


Here a supervised machine learning method is used to distinguish between different audio files. 

The original code used here has been previously developed by Derek Tingle to distinguish between different music genres:

Here, I have used this approach to distinguish between different audio files from

BBC Sound effects (https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/)

and

Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging)

to distinguish between sounds such as the sound of engines, Snoring, Drawer, tearing papers, cats and dogs etc.
